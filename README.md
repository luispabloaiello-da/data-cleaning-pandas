# Mini Project 1: Shark Attacks
# Surfing Shark Attack Data Cleaning & EDA - Surfing Insurance Provider

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global shark attack data with a focus on surfing-related incidents. The goal is to identify high-risk locations and demographics for launching a Surfing Insurance Provider business.

## Dataset
- Source: [Global Shark Attack File](https://www.sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/GSAF5.xls)
- Fields: Date, Year, Type, Country, State, Location, Activity, Sex, Age, Injury, Fatal Y/N, Species, etc.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the data
- **src/**: Python scripts for modular cleaning functions
- **README.md**: Project documentation
- **slides/**: Presentation slides (link below)

## Steps
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning: dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing values, standardizing text
3. Filtering for surfing-related shark attacks
4. Aggregating attacks by country, state, and beach
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
6. Insights extraction for business case

## Key Findings
- The USA has the highest number of surfing attacks, especially in Florida and California.
- Most attacks are non-fatal.
- Summer months show higher attack rates.
- Young male surfers are the most frequent victims.

## MVP Deliverable
- Cleaned dataset focused on surfing attacks
- Country/state/beach risk rankings
- EDA visualizations
- Recommendations for insurance pricing and launch locations
